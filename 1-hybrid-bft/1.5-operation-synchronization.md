# 1.5 Operation Synchronization

The precondition for entering the next phase does not require synchronization across all replicas. Due to the loss of connection or other reasons, one node may skip some operations. Though the consensus is still reached, the sequence number α is not necessarily continuous. But for clients who also access data from the network, operations are preferably synchronized on each replica. The discrete sequence number and the reached watermark can detect the asynchronous replica. A replica may extract the missing operations by inquiring about them from other nodes in real-time or at a constant interval. Once the replica decides to extract a missing operation from the rest of the network, it multicasts $$[nα, i, ν]_{extract−request}$$. If there are no fewer than $$2f+ 1$$ valid $$extract−reply$$, the replica accepts the reply as its missing operation. For the replica that received $$extract−request$$, it replies $$[O, α, i, ν]_{extract−reply}$$ if the request is valid.
