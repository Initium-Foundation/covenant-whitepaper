# 1.1 Overview

In this proposed BFT model, we outline a double-layer BFT called Hybrid BFT (HBFT) where there are two layers of nodes Layer-1 nodes and Layer-2 nodes. Layer-1 nodes are elected via a voting mechanism by all available nodes in the network. There are two major nodes in Layer-1, including the Prime node and Supervisor nodes.

The Prime node ($$p$$) is the cluster leader. This node receives the transactions from the clients and distributes them among the other nodes. The Supervisor node ($$S$$) is a sub-leader node, and every $$S$$ leads and supervises the nodes in the sub-cluster called Squad. A Minimum of 5 nodes and a maximum of 20 replica nodes called Verifiers ($$V$$) can form a Squad. A Squad and its $$S$$ node together form a Legion ($$L$$). The Legion is a sub-cluster in the main cluster. The number of $$V$$ in a $$L$$ is dynamic and set by the number of the available nodes in the network and the number of $$s$$ nodes elected by the available nodes in the network.

The HBFT inserts successive $$pre-prepare$$, $$prepare$$ and $$commmit$$ phases before starting the $$commit$$ phase in the upper layer.

The total available nodes ($$σ$$) will form as $$σ=1+S+SV$$.&#x20;
