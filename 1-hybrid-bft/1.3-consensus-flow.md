# 1.3 Consensus Flow

A client $$c$$ sends a request message $$[o,t,c]_{request}$$ to $$P$$.  This request invokes an operation $$o$$ with timestamp $$t$$. Timestamps are ordered by time, so the stamp of later operation contains higher values. The request is sent to the Supervisor nodes. The identity of the $$S$$ is extracted from the view number contained in replies from previous operations. On receiving the request, the Prime node multicasts messages using the protocol stated below.

![Fig. 2. Implementation ﬂow chart for Hybrid PBFT (HBFT) Model.](../.gitbook/assets/nodes-cluster.png)

As illustrated in Fig. 2., the Prime nodes reply results to the client directly. The $$post-reply$$ has the form $$[o,t,c,i,r,rc^1,v,GP]_{post-reply}$$ where $$v$$ is the current view number, $$i$$ is the replica number, $$r$$ is the result of the execution, $$rc$$ is the reply certiﬁcate, and $$GP$$ describes the replicas allocation.

Assuming there are a number of $$m$$ Supervisor nodes in the ﬁrst layer and $$n$$  verifiers in the second, and the number of faulty replicas in a consensus group is $$f^g$$. If Prime node has received $$f^g+1$$ matching valid replies from the same consensus group (Legion), this group is said to have reached consensus. The network reaches a consensus when more than half of the groups have the same replies. The client only accepts results replied from group leaders when at least half of them are consistent.

### 1.3.1 First Layer Protocol

If the first layer, the Prime and $$m$$ Supervisor nodes form a consensus group. When the Prime node $$p$$ receives a request $$M=[o,t,c]_{request}$$ from client, it authenticates the request and client's identity. Then $$p$$ assigns a sequence number $$α$$ to $$M$$. After that, $$p$$ steps in $$pre −prepare$$ phase by multicasting $$[M, d, α, ν ]_{pre−prepare^1}$$ where $$d$$ is the digest of $$M$$. Super-script is to distinguish $$pre −prepare^1$$ in the first layer for $$pre −prepare^2$$ in the second layer. Primary multicasts message only among $$S$$ nodes. Thus, only Supervisor nodes react on $$pre −prepare^1$$. The operation is restricted since the protocol runs layer by layer. for $$pre-prepare, prepare,$$ and $$commit$$ messages, a Supervisor node accepts the one with the same view $$v$$; the authenticity is then verified. $$α$$ is between watermark $$h$$ and $$H.$$

With conditions above, a given $$S$$ node $$i$$ in the first layer accepts a $$pre-prepare^1$$ message from $$p$$ when there is none different request with the same view $$v$$ and sequence number $$α$$ is accepted. Then it multicasts $$[d, α, i, ν]_{prepare^1}$$message to all $$S^1_i$$in the first later. It records both $$_{pre-prepare^1}$$ and $$_{prepare^1}$$messages to its log.

During $$prepare$$ phase, each node in connection with $$S^1_i$$ collects $$2f$$ messages with matching sequence number $$α$$, view $$v$$, and request $$M$$. With the received $$_{pre-prepare^1}$$message, they form $$_{prepared-certicifate^1}$$ which indicated a particular $$S^1_i$$ Verfier $$V$$(e.g., $$V^{S^1_i}_5$$) has prepared the request. For prepared $$S^1_i$$, it multicasts $$[d, α, i, ν]_{commit^1}$$ and waits for more $$2f+1$$ matching $$_{commit^1}$$ messages with same view, sequence, and digits from different $$V^{S^1_i}_i$$ verifiers. Received message from $$_{commit-certificate^1}$$ ($$cc^1$$) and this request is said to be committed on $$S^1_i$$. Then the Supervisor node pauses the execution and initiates another round of the protocol in the second layer as described in Section 1.3.2.&#x20;

The committed Supervisors send $$[o, t, i, r, ν]_{reply^1}$$ to the $$p$$. The Prime node confirms that this cluster group has reached a consensus by checking more than half of the Supervisors reply consistent $$_{reply^1}$$message, including itself. The Prime node $$p$$ collects $$_{reply^1}$$ and forms a reply-certiciate $$rc^1$$. It's important to note that it is not necessary for $$p$$ to reply to the client on behalf on consensus, but we require $$p$$ to do so to keep the algorithm the same on all nodes in case of massive deployment.&#x20;

### 1.3.2 Second Layer Protocol

A committed $$S$$ multicasts new $$pre-prepare$$ message to $$V^{S_i}_i$$ within the same Legion $$L$$ where another round of PBFT is implemented. All nodes reply to the Supervisor in the same manner described in Section 1.3.1 when the request is committed agagin. For a replica $$r^{1}_s$$ which acts as the Supervisor $$S$$ node, it multicasts a similar $$[M, d, α, ν, cc^1]_{pre-prepare^2}$$ to $$V^{S_i}_i$$replicas in same Legion where $$cc^1$$is the $$_{commit-certificate^1}$$. The $$v$$, $$α$$, and $$M$$are inherited from the previous process. A $$V^{S_i}_i$$ verifier will accept the request if the condition mentioned in the first layer protocol is satisfied, in addition to the presence of $$cc^1$$. In Covenant consensus, the conditions are implemented by $$S$$ using the _Intium Constitution Craft_.
