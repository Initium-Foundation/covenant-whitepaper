# 3.2 Conslusion

To its easiest definition, Covenant is a cluster-based synchronization protocol that uses clustering to achieve energy efficiency and resilience to faulty nodes in the system. Clustering techniques are known to reduce the energy expenditure of the nodes and provide routing through representative nodes called Cluster heads (CH) which is called Prime node in Initium. Since communication in Covenant follows the Proof of Synchronization, it involves only Prime and Supervisor nodes, and the number of messages exchanged is reduced significantly compared to other protocols.&#x20;

Covenant benefits from the HBFT model and various mechanisms from well-established consensuses, e.g., RAFT, are also employed in the Covenant.&#x20;

Covenant provides a low-latency, highly secure, decentralized, and highly scalable mechanism for decentralized applications and blockchain networks. Further improvements and developments will be implemented by Initium Foundation in the future.&#x20;
