# 2.3 Roles

In the Covenant consensus model, the available nodes in the network have the following roles;

* **Follower Nodes**: all nodes in the Initium network, without any specific position, are considered Follower. The Follower nodes join the Squad led by a Supervisor node to form a Legion.&#x20;
* **Candidate Nodes**: every Follower node on the Initium blockchain is eligible to be a candidate to be elected by the other nodes for being the Prime or Supervisor.&#x20;
* **Supervisor Nodes**: a Candidate node that receives the supermajority of votes among the nodes subjected to a legion can become a supervisor node. A Candidate node needs to send a voting request to the neighbor nodes (Squad) and receive the supermajority of votes to be the Supervisor. A Supervisor node and its electing Squad form a Legion together.&#x20;
* **Prime Node**: as the leader of the cluster in the Initium cluster, the prime node is a Candidate that receives the supermajority of the votes from all available nodes in the Initium blockchain. The election of the Prime node occurs before the election of supervisor nodes. The prime node leads the Supervisor nodes.&#x20;
