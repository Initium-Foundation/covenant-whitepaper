# 2.6 Hashing Function

Covenant uses the SHA256 algorithm to hash the data. Hashing new data starts with a cryptographic hash function, whose output is not predictable without running the function (e.g., SHA256). It runs the function from some random starting value, takes its output, and passes it as the input into the same function again. Record the number of times the function has been called and the output at each call.
